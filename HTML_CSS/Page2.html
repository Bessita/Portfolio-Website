    <p class="gallery-text">Fist attempt in designing a layout of a store in Malta (Valletta) called 'Cekcik'. This was made on Illustrator. I
      mainly used the shape tool, type tool, colors, opacity, the eye dropper tool, shading and highlighting. To outline the store I used the
      pen tool.</p>

  <br>
  <p class="gallery-text">This is a characteristic style of the second half of the 60s. Visual art and music covers were hugely known for this
    type of style. Style was influenced from drug usage, so I wanted to depict a woman crying from overdosing and ended up being stuck in her
    own thoughts and hallucinations.</p>

  <img src="steampunk.jpg" alt="Image of steampunk" class="galleryImage">
    <br>
    <p class="gallery-text">This was used for an assignment in my course, for game character design. Here I created a steampunk themed game
      character, which is a half cate and a half octopus creature. The main concept was to combine two creatures into one, that are completly
      different from each other in terms of species and make it look as natural as possible.</p>
